🚀 About Me

I'm a backend developer with a strong focus on database architecture, complex CRUD operations, and ETL processes. I design scalable and maintainable systems by carefully structuring databases, implementing procedural business logic, and optimizing data flows across platforms.
🛠️ Key Skills

    Database Design

        Architecting multi-application systems by separating databases and schemas

        Organizing initialized and generated datasets for easier deployment and maintenance

    Advanced CRUD Development

        Writing efficient and optimized SQL queries

        Implementing procedural functions directly in the database for business logic

        Supporting partial updates for better API performance

        Creating database-level middleware for logging and auditing

    Data Conversion & ETL

        Converting geospatial and Excel data into structured databases

        Building ETL pipelines using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for data migration across systems

I love turning complex data challenges into clean, reliable solutions. Let’s build something great.
