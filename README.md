## About Me

I'm a backend developer with a strong focus on database architecture, complex CRUD operations, and ETL processes. I design scalable and maintainable systems by carefully structuring databases, implementing procedural business logic, and optimizing data flows across platforms.

## 🛠️ Key Skills

* Database Design
  
  *  Architecting multi-application systems by separating databases and schemas

  *  Organizing initialized and generated datasets for easier deployment and maintenance

* Advanced CRUD Development

  *  Writing efficient and optimized SQL queries

  *  Implementing procedural functions directly in the database for business logic

  *  Supporting partial updates for better API performance

  *  Creating database-level middleware for logging and auditing

* Data Conversion & ETL
  
  *  Converting geospatial and Excel data into structured databases
  *  Building ETL pipelines using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for data migration across systems

I love turning complex data challenges into clean, reliable solutions. Let’s build something great.
